# Face-Recognition
Build a simple facial recognition system using OpenCV and a pre-trained  FaceNet model.  Load a pre-trained FaceNet model for facial embeddings.  Use OpenCV to capture images from a webcam. Compare embeddings to recognize known faces in real-time. Display the recognized names on the video stream.
